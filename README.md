# RISEIndicatorServer Documentation

## Overview

The RISEIndicatorServer is a robust Express.js-based server implementation designed to serve as a proxy for accessing RISE indicator values. This server incorporates essential security features, performance monitoring, and API documentation capabilities.

## Class Description

`RISEIndicatorServer` is a comprehensive server class that manages the setup and lifecycle of an Express application serving financial indicator data.

## Key Components

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the server with the following components:
- Express application instance
- RISE Indicator SDK integration
- Basic middleware configuration including JSON parsing
- Proxy trust settings for Replit environment

### Core Methods

#### setupMiddleware()
Configures essential middleware for security and performance:
- Helmet for security headers with flexible CSP settings
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes in production, 1000 in development)
- CORS configuration allowing cross-origin requests
- Request compression
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Request logging with Winston

#### setupRoutes()
Establishes the server's endpoints:
- `/api/indicator-values`: Main endpoint for retrieving indicator data
- `/metrics`: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- `/api-docs`: Swagger documentation interface

#### setupErrorHandling()
Implements comprehensive error management:
- Custom 404 handler for undefined routes
- Global error handler with environment-aware error messages
- Structured error logging

#### start(port)
Initiates the server:
- Default port: 5000 (configurable via environment)
- Returns a Promise for async operation
- Includes error handling for startup issues
- Prevents duplicate server instances

#### stop()
Gracefully terminates the server:
- Closes existing connections
- Returns a Promise for async operation
- Includes cleanup procedures

## Request Validation

The server implements Zod schema validation for incoming requests with the following requirements:
- `symbol`: Non-empty string
- `params`: Valid JSON string
- `timeRange`: Optional string (defaults to '1d')

## Monitoring and Metrics

Prometheus metrics collection includes:
- Request duration tracking
- Total request counting
- Method, route, and status code labeling

## Security Features

The server implements several security measures:
- Helmet middleware for header protection
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Trust proxy settings for Replit compatibility

## API Documentation

Swagger documentation is available at `/api-docs` with:
- Interactive API explorer
- Request/response examples
- Parameter documentation
- Custom styling and configuration

## Error Handling

The server provides structured error handling:
- Validation errors (400 status code)
- Rate limiting errors (429 status code)
- Server errors (500 status code)
- Detailed error logging in development
- Sanitized error messages in production

## Conclusion

The RISEIndicatorServer provides a secure, monitored, and well-documented proxy service for accessing financial indicator data. Its modular design allows for easy maintenance and extension, while built-in security features and performance monitoring make it suitable for production deployment. The comprehensive error handling and logging systems facilitate debugging and maintenance, making it a reliable choice for serving financial data through a REST API.
